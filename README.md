                    GIS Playground

GIS Playground is an interactive web application that allows users to upload and visualize geospatial TIFF images on a MapLibre map. The application supports switching between different basemaps, adjusting the opacity of the uploaded images, and provides information about the image location and weather conditions. It also allows you to create, import and export vector features, provisions styling the features, and add additional data to the features.
